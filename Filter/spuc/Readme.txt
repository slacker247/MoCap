Readme
Complex class is very similar to the Standard C++ library complex class and the standard C++ class could be substituted in many cases.
Code is wrapped in namespace SPUC

SPUC DSP C++ source code library directory structure

array - Array class from TNT library
comm  - primarily digital communications related classes
equalizers - Maximum Likelihood Sequence Detector, RLS and LMS algorithms
generic - most of the code/algorithms
functions - mostly functions (as opposed to classes)
matrix  - Matrix/Vector class from IT++
specializations - mostly variations of basic blocks in generic
utility - classes to aid in debug
examples - Examples directory including
		qpsk - QPSK + QPSK_VR examples
