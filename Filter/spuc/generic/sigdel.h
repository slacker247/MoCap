//!    All-digital sigma delta converter
//!    Performs Sigma Delta function in digital domain
//!    for use when output will go to a (nbit_out) D/A converter.
//!    Default is 8 bits in, 1 bit out.
//!    After construction, call single() to get output.
//!    Multirate performed by calling single() with same input
//!    at the higher sampling rate.
