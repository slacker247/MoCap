/*!   \brief  Template Class for Allpass halfband IIR Filter
  \ingroup iir
*/
//!:
//!   The filter is a combination of 2 Allpass sections of 
//!   the form  G(z) =  (a*z*z + 1)/(z*z+a)
//!   so that the overall H(z) is
//!   H(z) = 1/z*G(z,a0) + G(z,a1)
//!   The combination of these two allpass functions result
//!   in a lowpass/highpass complementary pair. The class only
//!   uses the low pass filter.
//!   This is similar to allpass_iir, except since this is used
//!   as a halfband filter the output samples are decimated by 2. 
//!   So that if the member function clock is called at the higher
//!   (input) sampling rate, the outputs are only valid even second
//!   sample. This is taken advantage off by running the individual
//!   sections effectively at the lower rate. 
//!   The invalid samples are set to zero.
//!   This class needs the allpass_1 class
